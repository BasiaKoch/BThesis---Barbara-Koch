# ðŸ§  BThesis---Barbara-Koch

Welcome! This repository contains the code and supporting materials for my **Bachelorâ€™s thesis**, which investigates how modern deep learning architectures perform on the task of segmenting brain tumors in MRI scans. The project compares two state-of-the-art models: **nnU-Net** (based on convolutional neural networks) and **Swin UNETR** (a transformer-based model), using the **BraTS2020** dataset.

> ðŸ§© **Note**: This repository builds upon publicly available implementations from:
> - [MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) â€“ the official nnU-Net codebase
> - [Inc0mple/3D_Brain_Tumor_Seg_V2](https://github.com/Inc0mple/3D_Brain_Tumor_Seg_V2) â€“ Swin UNETR training pipeline and structure

These frameworks provided the foundation for model training, testing, and comparison, which were adapted for the purposes of this thesis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Aim

The goal of this thesis was to evaluate and compare the performance of CNN-based and transformer-based approaches in the segmentation of glioma subregions:

- **Whole Tumor (WT)**
- **Tumor Core (TC)**
- **Enhancing Tumor (ET)**

By training both models under the same resource constraints and without pretrained weights, the project explores their strengths, limitations, and suitability for different clinical objectives.

## ðŸ§  Pretrained Model Weights

The pretrained weights for both segmentation models used in this project are available below:

- ðŸŒ€ **Swin UNETR** (Transformer-based):
  [Download `your_best_model_20250414-004601.pth`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lEjkvGCFt4yLCkP-OvhpKjnd4zrHOVT-/view?usp=drive_link)

- ðŸ§© **nnU-Net** (CNN-based):
  [Download `nnunet_best_model.pth`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HCK1qAsZj2TgxeGd8Rg4gVG81Z8gZodV/view?usp=sharing)

After downloading, place the weights in a suitable directory (e.g., `./weights/`) and update your loading scripts accordingly:

```python
# Example
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("weights/your_best_model_20250414-004601.pth"))
