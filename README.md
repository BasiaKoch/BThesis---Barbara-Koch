# ðŸ§  BThesis---Barbara-Koch

Welcome! This repository contains the code and supporting materials for my **Bachelorâ€™s thesis**, which investigates how modern deep learning architectures perform on the task of segmenting brain tumors in MRI scans. The project compares two state-of-the-art models: **nnU-Net** (based on convolutional neural networks) and **Swin UNETR** (a transformer-based model), using the **BraTS2020** dataset.

> ðŸ§© **Note**: This repository builds upon publicly available implementations from:
> - [MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) â€“ the official nnU-Net codebase
> - [Inc0mple/3D_Brain_Tumor_Seg_V2](https://github.com/Inc0mple/3D_Brain_Tumor_Seg_V2) â€“ Swin UNETR training pipeline and structure

These frameworks provided the foundation for model training, testing, and comparison, which were adapted for the purposes of this thesis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Aim

The goal of this thesis was to evaluate and compare the performance of CNN-based and transformer-based approaches in the segmentation of glioma subregions:

- **Whole Tumor (WT)**
- **Tumor Core (TC)**
- **Enhancing Tumor (ET)**

By training both models under the same resource constraints and without pretrained weights, the project explores their strengths, limitations, and suitability for different clinical objectives.
