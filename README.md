# BThesis---Barbara-Koch
Welcome! This repository contains the code and supporting materials for my Bachelorâ€™s thesis, which investigates how modern deep learning architectures perform on the task of segmenting brain tumors in MRI scans. The project compares two state-of-the-art models: nnU-Net (based on convolutional neural networks) and Swin UNETR (a transformer-based model), using the BraTS2020 dataset.
